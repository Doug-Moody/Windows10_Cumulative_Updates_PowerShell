# Windows10_Cumulative_Updates_PowerShell
This powershell script can be ran on a system and will identify if a system is patched for CVE-2020-0601 "Curveball" and if not will then download the appropriate patch and execute.  Only works for Windows 10 1507-1909, didn't include for arm based CPUs or embedded versions.  Will update for Server 2016 later.
